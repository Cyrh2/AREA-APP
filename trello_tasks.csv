"Harmonize action/reaction UI schema naming","Ensure `ui_schema`/`config_schema` naming is consistent in service payloads and config endpoints; expose reaction schemas in /services response.",backend,Medium,2,"server/src/controllers/serviceController.js; server/src/services/index.js","Frontends (mobile + web) receive consistent `ui_schema` for actions and reactions and parsing logic works without warnings.",Open

"Add HOWTOCONTRIBUTE.md","Create contribution guide explaining how to add new services, actions, reactions and how to run tests locally.",docs,Medium,3,"HOWTOCONTRIBUTE.md; README.md","Guide contains step-by-step to add a service module, DB schema hints, example code snippet, testing notes and where to update registry.",Open
"Implement GET /services/:serviceSlug/reactions/:reactionName/config (server route)","Add route mapping and controller method specifically for reaction config endpoint (complements action config route).",backend,Medium,1,"server/src/routes/serviceRoutes.js; server/src/controllers/serviceController.js","Route responds with JSON schema for reaction or 404 if not found. Frontends call this route successfully.",Open
"Add missing client-side stubs for unavailable provider data","If provider APIs cannot be implemented now, add server-side stubs that return safe, descriptive placeholder arrays to avoid frontend crashes.",backend,Medium,1,"server/src/controllers/* (service controllers)","Frontend selects show placeholder options and no errors occur when providers not connected.",Open
"Add unit/integration tests for cron runner (processArea)","Create tests that simulate area records and verify trigger/execute flow with mocks for actions/reactions and token retrieval.",tests,Low,16,"server/tests/test_cron.js; server/src/services/cron.js","CI runs tests and they validate processArea triggers reactions as expected and updates last_executed_at.",Open
"Add CI workflow (lint/tests/build)","Add GitHub Actions workflow to run lint, tests, and optionally build for Web and server on PR.",ci,Low,8,".github/workflows/ci.yml","PRs run lint + unit tests; pipeline fails on lint/test errors.",Open
"Frontend: Add GET /areas/:id usage fallback check","Update mobile/web to gracefully fallback to list filtering if GET /areas/:id temporarily missing (short-term fix).",frontend,Low,1,"area_mobile/src/screens/AreaDetailsScreen.tsx; Web/src/pages/*","Apps handle missing endpoint gracefully with user message and instruction to refresh. (Temporary)",Open
"UX: Improve CreateAreaWizard validation","Add client-side validation for required fields from ui_schema and clear error messages before submitting createArea.",frontend,Low,8,"Web/src/components/CreateAreaWizard.tsx; area_mobile/src/screens/CreateAreaScreen.tsx","Required field flags shown, prevent submission when validation fails, and display which fields are missing.",Open
"Inventory & map service implementations","Document each service module and list implemented action/reaction slugs for project README and HOWTOCONTRIBUTE.",docs,Low,3,"server/src/services/*; area_project_doc.md","README/HowTo includes table listing services and their action/reaction slugs; getAllServices reports them in /about.json.",Open
"Refactor service registry logging","Make service loader warnings/errors clearer and produce a list at startup for missing DB/runtime mismatches.",backend,Low,2,"server/src/services/index.js","Startup log prints summary: loaded services, missing implementations, and mismatched slugs.",Open
"Optional: Add example supabase SQL or migration","Provide migration SQL snippets or a dump for tables: users, services, actions, reactions, areas, oauth_tokens.",docs,Low,6,"docs/supabase_migration.sql; README.md","Developers can run provided SQL to create required tables and sample data for local dev.",Open
